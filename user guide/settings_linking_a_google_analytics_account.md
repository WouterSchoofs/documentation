# Settings: Linking a Google Analytics account

The [analytics module](http://www.fork-cms.com/extensions/detail/analytics) requires you to link a Google Analytics account to Fork. This article will guide you through the process of setting up the analytics module.

## 1. Creating an API key

Go to the [Google API's console](https://code.google.com/apis/console/). If it is the first time, you will need to create a project.

Go to the *Services* page and activate the *Analytics API* by changing the status to "ON". You might need to agree with the terms of service.
