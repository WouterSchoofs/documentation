# Adding modules

Modules are parts of the cms that extend the core functionality. An overview of modules for Fork CMS is available in the [extensions](http://www.fork-cms.com/extensions/apps) section. Some modules are already packed within the original download, take a look at the modules that are uploaded to your setup by going to settings > modules.

The list at the top displays modules that already installed, while the list at the bottom shows the modules that are available on your system but not installed yet. To upload a new module that you found on the [extension](http://www.fork-cms.com/extensions/apps) page, download the module and press *upload module* in the modules overview.
