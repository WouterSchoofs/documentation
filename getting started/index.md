# Getting started

We assume that you already succesfully [installed](#todo) the software and are now ready to start configuring your website. You'll find the private website configuration system in http://yourdomain.com/private. 

Once you logged in you come on the dashboard, which gives you an overview of what's going on on your website. Notice that there is a Analyses section too, what tells you which settings gave an error. You'll find the same list on the settings page.

After going through all the pages of this section, the list should be empty.
